## Description

Since eigensolver accuracy isn't the bottleneck, investigate differences in how the spectral embedding is constructed or used. Compare the actual embedding matrices between our implementation and sklearn's to identify discrepancies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Export spectral embeddings from both implementations
- [x] Compare embeddings element-wise for test cases
- [x] Identify any normalization or processing differences
- [x] Fix embedding construction to match sklearn
- [ ] Improve ARI scores on failing tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Create script to extract spectral embedding from our implementation
2. Create Python script to extract embedding from sklearn
3. Compare embeddings for a failing test case (e.g., circles_n2_knn)
4. Check for differences in:
   - Row normalization (we removed it based on 12.4 findings)
   - Eigenvector selection
   - Sign conventions
   - Ordering
5. Implement any fixes needed
6. Verify improvements on fixture tests

## Implementation Notes

### Investigation Summary

Compared spectral embeddings between our implementation and sklearn to identify differences.

### Key Findings

1. **Initial hypothesis was wrong**: I initially thought sklearn applies 'diffusion map' scaling (multiply eigenvectors by sqrt(1-eigenvalue)), but this is NOT what SpectralClustering uses by default.

2. **sklearn uses raw eigenvectors**: SpectralClustering.fit() uses the raw eigenvectors from the normalized Laplacian without any additional scaling.

3. **The D^(-1/2) normalization is already included**: When computing eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian, the D^(-1/2) scaling is already baked in. No additional normalization needed.

4. **Our original implementation was correct**: After removing the unnecessary diffusion scaling and D^(-1/2) normalization we added, we're back to the original implementation which matches sklearn's approach.

### Test Results

Still 5/12 tests passing (41.7%), but notably:
- moons_n3_rbf improved to 0.946 (very close to passing!)
- Most failures have high ARI (0.72-0.90) suggesting small differences

### Conclusion

The embedding construction is now correct and matches sklearn. The remaining differences are likely due to:
1. RBF fixtures having incorrect gamma values (confirmed in task 12.5)
2. Small numerical differences in eigensolver or k-means implementation
3. Non-deterministic aspects of k-means clustering

No further changes to embedding construction needed.
