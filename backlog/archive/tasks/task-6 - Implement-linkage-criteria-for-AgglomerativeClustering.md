## Description

Implement the core linkage criteria algorithms (ward, complete, average, single) that determine how clusters are merged in the hierarchical clustering process

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Single linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [x] Complete linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [x] Average linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [x] Ward linkage criterion implemented with variance calculations
- [x] Distance matrix update logic for each linkage type
- [x] Unit tests validating linkage calculations
- [x] Integration tests with small example datasets

## Implementation Plan

1. Design API for linkage update independent from Agglomerative class.
2. Implement Lanceâ€“Williams recurrences for four linkage types.
3. Mutate distance matrix in place and maintain cluster size bookkeeping.
4. Write unit tests asserting distance updates, symmetry and bookkeeping.

## Implementation Notes

- Added `src/clustering/linkage.ts` with `update_distance_matrix` supporting
  single, complete, average and Ward linkage; Ward uses variance-based
  formula for numerical stability.
- Function works on simple `number[][]` avoiding TensorFlow overhead.
- Added `test/linkage.test.ts` covering all linkage criteria on toy dataset;
  also validates matrix contraction and cluster size updates.
- Documentation improved, checked edge cases (i>j handling, self-merge).
