## Description

The 5 failing RBF tests have eigenvectors that differ from sklearn by up to 0.0065, causing k-means to produce different clusters (ARI ~0.87 instead of 1.0). Investigate ways to make k-means more robust to these small numerical differences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] K-means produces consistent clusters despite small eigenvector differences
- [ ] Failing RBF tests achieve ARI >= 0.95
- [ ] No regression in passing tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze k-means behavior on failing tests
2. Check current k-means initialization (k-means++ implementation)
3. Try consensus clustering - run k-means multiple times with different seeds
4. Investigate alternative label assignment: discretization instead of k-means
5. Test increasing nInit parameter for more k-means attempts
6. Consider preprocessing: normalize eigenvectors more carefully
7. Debug specific failing cases to understand cluster flip patterns

## Implementation Notes

Investigated multiple approaches to make k-means less sensitive to small eigenvector differences:

### 1. Consensus Clustering Implementation

- Created `SpectralClusteringConsensus` class that runs k-means multiple times with different seeds
- Uses simple majority vote to determine final cluster assignments
- Results:
  - **Improves 2-cluster cases**: circles_n2_rbf (0.87→1.0), moons_n2_rbf (0.93→1.0)
  - **Fails on 3-cluster cases**: Produces worse results or NaN due to label switching issues
  - The simple majority vote doesn't handle different label permutations properly

### 2. Increasing nInit Parameter

- Tested nInit values of 10, 50, 100, 200
- **No improvement**: Results are completely deterministic regardless of nInit
- This confirms that the eigenvector differences cause consistent but different k-means results
- The issue is not random initialization - it's the systematic difference in the embedding

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

- Our Jacobi eigensolver produces slightly different eigenvectors than sklearn's ARPACK
- These differences (up to 0.0065) are small but enough to change k-means clustering
- The k-means implementation itself is correct - it's deterministically clustering different inputs
- Increasing iterations or changing random seeds doesn't help because the embedding is consistently different

### 4. Remaining Options

- **Discretization**: Implement sklearn's alternative label assignment method
- **Better eigensolver**: Use a different eigendecomposition algorithm (see task 12.23)
- **Preprocessing**: Try different eigenvector normalization or scaling approaches
- **Accept lower accuracy**: Consider if 0.87 ARI is acceptable for pure JS implementation

The consensus approach showed promise for 2-cluster cases but needs better label matching for multi-cluster problems. The fundamental issue remains: our eigenvectors are slightly different from sklearn's.

### 5. Detailed Test Results

**Failing RBF Tests Analysis:**

- circles_n2_rbf: ARI = 0.8689 (consensus → 1.0000) ✅
- moons_n2_rbf: ARI = 0.9333 (consensus → 1.0000) ✅
- circles_n3_rbf: ARI = 0.7675 (consensus → 0.3445) ❌
- moons_n3_rbf: ARI = 0.8409 (consensus → NaN) ❌
- blobs_n3_rbf: ARI = 1.0000 (already passing)

**Key Insights:**

1. 2-cluster problems benefit from consensus voting
2. 3-cluster problems suffer due to label permutation issues
3. NaN results indicate empty clusters in consensus voting
4. The eigenvector differences are consistent and deterministic

### 6. Implementation Details

**Files Created:**

- `src/clustering/spectral_consensus.ts` - SpectralClusteringConsensus class
- `test_consensus_clustering.ts` - Tests consensus approach on failing fixtures
- `test_ninit_improvement.ts` - Tests different nInit parameter values
- `test_kmeans_improvement.ts` - General k-means improvement testing

**SpectralClusteringConsensus Implementation:**

- Extends base SpectralClustering class
- Re-computes spectral embedding (parent doesn't store it)
- Runs k-means `consensusRuns` times (default 50)
- Uses Map to count label occurrences per point
- Selects most common label via simple majority vote

### 7. Conclusion

Task completed with partial success. While we achieved perfect accuracy for 2-cluster cases using consensus clustering, the approach fails for 3-cluster cases. The core issue - eigenvector differences between our Jacobi solver and sklearn's ARPACK - remains unresolved.

**Achievement Summary:**

- ✅ Identified and quantified the root cause (eigenvector differences)
- ✅ Implemented consensus clustering approach
- ✅ Improved 2-cluster test cases to perfect accuracy
- ❌ Failed to improve 3-cluster test cases
- ❌ Unable to achieve ≥0.95 ARI for all failing tests

**Next Steps:**

1. Task 12.23: Investigate alternative eigensolvers (power iteration, Lanczos)
2. Implement proper label matching for consensus (Hungarian algorithm)
3. Try discretization label assignment instead of k-means
4. Consider accepting 87-93% accuracy as reasonable for pure JS
