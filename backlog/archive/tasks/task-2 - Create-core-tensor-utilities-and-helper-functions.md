## Description

Using the TensorFlow.js libraries (tfjs and tfjs-node), implement essential tensor manipulation utilities and helper functions that will be used across all clustering algorithms and metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Distance calculation functions implemented (euclidean, manhattan, cosine)
- [x] Tensor conversion utilities created (arrayToTensor, tensorToArray)
- [x] Memory management wrapper functions using tf.tidy()
- [x] Broadcast operations for efficient tensor computations
- [x] Unit tests for all utility functions with edge cases
- [x] Performance benchmarks for critical operations
