## Description

Create the basic class structure for AgglomerativeClustering with constructor, parameter validation, and method stubs following the design specification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AgglomerativeClustering class created with proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Constructor accepts AgglomerativeClusteringParams interface
- [x] Parameter validation implemented (nClusters, linkage, metric)
- [x] Class properties defined (labels_, children_, nLeaves_)
- [x] Method stubs created for fit() and fitPredict()
- [x] Unit tests for class instantiation and parameter validation

## Implementation Plan

1. Define common types in `src/clustering/types.ts`.
2. Implement skeleton class in `src/clustering/agglomerative.ts` with:
   • Constructor & public `params` property.
   • Validation helper covering all rules in AC.
   • Public result properties (`labels_`, `children_`, `nLeaves_`).
   • Async stubs for `fit` and `fitPredict`.
3. Write Jest unit tests under `test/clustering/agglomerative.test.ts` to cover:
   • Successful instantiation with default params.
   • All validation error scenarios.
   • Stubs throwing un-implemented errors.
4. Run tests & lint.

## Implementation Notes

- Added full TypeScript implementation as described above.
- Validation rules include additional Ward-Euclidean consistency check.
- Tests confirm behaviour and currently pass (`npm test`).
- Further algorithmic logic will be implemented in later tasks; interface already stable.
