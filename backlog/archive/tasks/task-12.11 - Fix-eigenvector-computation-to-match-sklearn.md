## Description

Our eigenvectors have the correct structure (same zero/non-zero pattern) but different numerical values than sklearn's. This is causing the blobs_n2 test to fail with ARI=0.088. sklearn's eigenvectors have exactly 3 unique values per column for disconnected component cases, while ours have many unique values.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Compare our normalized Laplacian computation with sklearn/scipy line by line
- [ ] Check if eigenvector post-processing or scaling differs
- [ ] Verify our eigenvectors match sklearn's for test cases
- [ ] Achieve same unique-values pattern for disconnected components
- [ ] Fix blobs_n2 to achieve ARI > 0.95

## Implementation Plan

1. Download sklearn's Laplacian computation code for reference
2. Create side-by-side comparison of Laplacian matrix values
3. Compare eigensolver approaches (ARPACK vs Jacobi)
4. Analyze eigenvector post-processing differences
5. Test fixes on blobs_n2 fixture

## Implementation Notes

### Key Findings

1. **k-NN affinity bug fixed**: The `compute_knn_affinity` function had a bug when `includeSelf=true`. It was selecting only k neighbors total instead of k+1 (self + k neighbors). Fixed in line 136 of affinity.ts.

2. **Laplacian computation is correct**: Our normalized Laplacian computation matches scipy's exactly. Both ignore diagonal entries and produce the same values.

3. **Root cause identified**: The blobs_n2 dataset with k=10 creates **3 disconnected components** instead of 2. This happens because the k-NN graph doesn't fully connect each true cluster.

4. **sklearn's approach**:
   - sklearn gets 3 eigenvectors with near-zero eigenvalues (one per component)
   - These eigenvectors have exactly 3 unique values each (component indicators)
   - sklearn uses `drop_first=True` to drop one eigenvector, keeping 2 for the 2-cluster problem
   - This works because the 3 components can be grouped into 2 clusters

5. **Our implementation difference**:
   - We correctly identify the 3 zero eigenvalues
   - We return the first 2 eigenvectors (for n_clusters=2)
   - However, our eigenvectors have many unique values (14-15) instead of 3
   - This suggests our eigensolver is computing different eigenvectors than scipy's ARPACK

### Next Steps

The issue is not in the Laplacian computation but in the eigenvector computation for the zero eigenvalues. We need to investigate why our Jacobi solver produces different eigenvectors than scipy's ARPACK for the degenerate case of multiple zero eigenvalues.

Fixed k-NN affinity bug but ARI remains 0.0876. Root cause identified: eigenvector computation differences for disconnected graphs. Created follow-up tasks 12.18 and 12.19.
