## Description

Implement module augmentation and conditional types for platform-aware type safety

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] types.d.ts created with module augmentation
- [x] Node-specific types augmented to tfjs-core
- [x] Conditional types for backend-aware API
- [x] Generic types on Clustering class
- [x] Full type safety maintained across platforms

## Implementation Plan

1. Create clustering-types.d.ts for platform-specific type definitions
2. Add module augmentation for Node.js specific features
3. Create conditional types for backend detection
4. Add generic types to Clustering namespace
5. Update tsconfig.json to include type definitions
6. Test type safety in both environments

## Implementation Notes

Created clustering-types.d.ts with platform detection types and conditional features. Added platform awareness to Clustering namespace with runtime detection. Created type definitions for multi-platform support. All types compile correctly and are properly exported.
