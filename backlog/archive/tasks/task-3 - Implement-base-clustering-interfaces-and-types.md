## Description

Define TypeScript interfaces and base classes that establish the API contract for all clustering algorithms, following scikit-learn conventions adapted for TypeScript

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Base clustering interface defined with fit() and fitPredict() methods
- [x] Parameter interfaces for each algorithm created
- [x] Type definitions for input/output data formats
- [x] Async/Promise-based method signatures established
- [x] JSDoc documentation for all interfaces
- [x] Export structure defined in index.ts
