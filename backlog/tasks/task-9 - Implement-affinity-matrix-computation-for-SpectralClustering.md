## Description

Implement the affinity matrix construction supporting both RBF (Gaussian kernel) and nearest neighbors approaches for building the similarity graph

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RBF kernel affinity matrix implementation with gamma parameter
- [ ] Nearest neighbors affinity matrix with k-NN search
- [ ] Efficient pairwise distance calculations
- [ ] Sparse matrix handling for nearest neighbors
- [ ] Symmetrization of affinity matrix
- [ ] Unit tests for both affinity types
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
