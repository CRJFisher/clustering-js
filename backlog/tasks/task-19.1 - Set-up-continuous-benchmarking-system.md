## Description

Create an automated benchmarking system that tracks performance metrics across commits to prevent regressions and measure optimization impacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark suite for all algorithms created
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked:
  - [ ] Execution time
  - [ ] Memory usage (peak and average)
  - [ ] Accuracy (ARI scores)
  - [ ] Backend initialization time
- [ ] Backend comparison matrix:
  - [ ] CPU vs WASM vs WebGL vs tfjs-node vs tfjs-node-gpu
  - [ ] Performance ratios documented
  - [ ] Cost/benefit analysis for each backend
- [ ] Automated benchmark runs in CI pipeline
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Benchmark results visualization
- [ ] Historical performance tracking
- [ ] Comparison with scikit-learn baseline

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Impact Analysis

1. **Key Questions to Answer**:
   - Is tfjs-node worth the native dependency complexity?
   - When does GPU acceleration actually help?
   - Is WASM significantly better than pure JS?
   - What's the real-world impact on clustering quality?

2. **Benchmark Design**:

   ```typescript
   const benchmarks = {
     small: { samples: 100, features: 10 }, // Quick tests
     medium: { samples: 1000, features: 50 }, // Typical use case
     large: { samples: 10000, features: 100 }, // Stress test
     xlarge: { samples: 100000, features: 200 }, // GPU territory
   };

   const algorithms = ['KMeans', 'SpectralClustering', 'Agglomerative'];
   const backends = ['cpu', 'wasm', 'webgl', 'tfjs-node', 'tfjs-node-gpu'];
   ```

3. **Expected Findings** (to validate):
   - **CPU backend**: Baseline, works everywhere
   - **WASM**: 2-5x faster than CPU for math operations
   - **WebGL**: Good for parallel ops, but overhead for small datasets
   - **tfjs-node**: 5-20x faster than WASM
   - **tfjs-node-gpu**: Only worth it for large datasets (>10k samples)

4. **Decision Criteria**:
   - If tfjs-node is <2x faster than WASM → not worth the complexity
   - If GPU only helps at >100k samples → document as "enterprise only"
   - If WASM is within 20% of CPU → might not need it

5. **Output**: Backend recommendation matrix

   ```txt
   | Dataset Size | Recommended Backend | Speedup | Complexity |
   |--------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
   | <1k samples  | WASM              | 2x      | Low        |
   | 1k-10k       | tfjs-node         | 10x     | Medium     |
   | >10k         | tfjs-node-gpu     | 50x     | High       |
   ```
