## Description

Create an automated benchmarking system that tracks performance metrics across commits to prevent regressions and measure optimization impacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark suite for all algorithms created
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked (time
- [ ] memory
- [ ] accuracy)
- [ ] Automated benchmark runs in CI pipeline
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Benchmark results visualization
- [ ] Historical performance tracking
- [ ] Comparison with scikit-learn baseline
