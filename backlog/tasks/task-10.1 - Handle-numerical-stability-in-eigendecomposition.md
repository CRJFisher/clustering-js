## Description

Implement robust handling of numerical issues that can arise during eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian, including near-zero eigenvalues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detection of numerical instability conditions
- [ ] Regularization strategies implemented
- [ ] Handling of disconnected graph components
- [ ] Fallback strategies for degenerate cases
- [ ] Warning system for numerical issues
- [ ] Unit tests for edge cases (disconnected graphs
- [ ] identical points)
