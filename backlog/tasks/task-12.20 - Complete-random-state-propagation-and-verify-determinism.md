## Description

Ensure that the random state is properly propagated and used consistently throughout the entire spectral clustering pipeline. Check that k-means initialization, tie-breaking in k-NN, and any other stochastic components are using the random state correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all random operations in spectral pipeline
- [ ] Verify k-NN tie-breaking uses randomState
- [ ] Ensure Jacobi solver is deterministic
- [ ] Add multi-seed determinism tests
- [ ] Document all sources of randomness
