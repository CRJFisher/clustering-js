## Description

After implementing all fixes, create a comprehensive comparison framework with sklearn to understand any remaining differences. This should test both fixture data and synthetic datasets to ensure our implementation achieves parity or document acceptable differences.

**Expected results based on cluster analysis**:

- Blobs datasets should achieve near-perfect scores due to excellent separation
- Circles and moons datasets are inherently challenging due to overlapping, non-convex shapes
- k-NN affinity is expected to outperform RBF on overlapping clusters
- Focus on understanding why sklearn succeeds on these challenging cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison framework
- [ ] Test with fixture data AND synthetic data
- [ ] Profile numerical differences at each pipeline step
- [ ] Add detailed eigenvector value comparison (unique values, scaling, normalization)
- [ ] Compare Laplacian matrix values directly between implementations
- [ ] Document all remaining differences
- [ ] Achieve 10/12 fixture tests passing or document why not
