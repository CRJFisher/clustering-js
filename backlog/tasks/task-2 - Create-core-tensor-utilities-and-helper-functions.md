## Description

Using the TensorFlow.js libraries (tfjs and tfjs-node), implement essential tensor manipulation utilities and helper functions that will be used across all clustering algorithms and metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Distance calculation functions implemented (euclidean, manhattan, cosine)
- [ ] Tensor conversion utilities created (arrayToTensor, tensorToArray)
- [ ] Memory management wrapper functions using tf.tidy()
- [ ] Broadcast operations for efficient tensor computations
- [ ] Unit tests for all utility functions with edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical operations
