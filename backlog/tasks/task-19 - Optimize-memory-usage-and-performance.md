## Description

Profile and optimize the implementations for memory efficiency and performance, particularly for large datasets, ensuring proper tensor disposal and minimizing allocations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory profiling tools integrated
- [ ] Tensor disposal audit completed
- [ ] Memory leaks identified and fixed
- [ ] Batch processing for large datasets implemented
- [ ] TensorFlow.js backend acceleration configured (WebGL/WASM/CPU selection)
- [ ] GPU acceleration tested and documented
- [ ] WebAssembly SIMD optimizations enabled where available
- [ ] Dynamic backend selection based on runtime capabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks against various dataset sizes
- [ ] Optimization guide documented
- [ ] Comparison with native scikit-learn performance
