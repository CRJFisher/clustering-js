## Description

Profile and optimize the implementations for memory efficiency and performance, particularly for large datasets, ensuring proper tensor disposal and minimizing allocations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory profiling tools integrated
- [ ] Tensor disposal audit completed
- [ ] Memory leaks identified and fixed
- [ ] Batch processing for large datasets implemented
- [ ] Test and benchmark all TensorFlow.js backends:
  - [ ] CPU backend (baseline)
  - [ ] WebGL backend (browser GPU acceleration)
  - [ ] WASM backend (WebAssembly)
  - [ ] Node.js native C++ backend (tfjs-node)
  - [ ] CUDA backend (tfjs-node-gpu) if available
- [ ] WebAssembly SIMD optimizations enabled where available
- [ ] Dynamic backend selection based on runtime capabilities
- [ ] Backend-specific optimization recommendations documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks against various dataset sizes
- [ ] Optimization guide documented
- [ ] Comparison with native scikit-learn performance

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Testing Strategy

1. **Create backend test suite**:

   ```typescript
   // Test each backend with same datasets
   const backends = ['cpu', 'webgl', 'wasm', 'tensorflow'];
   const datasets = [small, medium, large];
   ```

2. **Key metrics to measure**:
   - Execution time for each algorithm (KMeans, SpectralClustering, Agglomerative)
   - Memory usage peak and average
   - Tensor allocation/disposal patterns
   - Backend-specific limitations (e.g., WebGL texture size limits)

3. **Expected performance characteristics**:
   - **CPU**: Most compatible, baseline performance
   - **WebGL**: Fast for parallel operations, limited by texture memory
   - **WASM**: Good for CPU-intensive ops, benefits from SIMD
   - **tfjs-node**: Best performance in Node.js, native C++ bindings
   - **tfjs-node-gpu**: Fastest for large datasets if CUDA available

4. **Backend selection logic**:
   - Auto-detect best backend based on environment
   - Allow manual override via configuration
   - Provide warnings for suboptimal backend choices
