## Description

Define TypeScript interfaces and base classes that establish the API contract for all clustering algorithms, following scikit-learn conventions adapted for TypeScript

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Base clustering interface defined with fit() and fitPredict() methods
- [ ] Parameter interfaces for each algorithm created
- [ ] Type definitions for input/output data formats
- [ ] Async/Promise-based method signatures established
- [ ] JSDoc documentation for all interfaces
- [ ] Export structure defined in index.ts
