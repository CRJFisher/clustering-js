## Description

Implement the Silhouette score which measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, ranging from -1 to +1

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Function signature matches design specification
- [x] Full pairwise distance matrix computation
- [x] Cohesion calculation (a(i)) for each sample
- [x] Separation calculation (b(i)) for each sample
- [x] Individual silhouette coefficient computation
- [x] Mean silhouette score calculation
- [x] Handling of edge cases (single cluster)
- [x] Unit tests covering various scenarios
- [x] Validation against scikit-learn implementation

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement full silhouette score with pairwise distance computation
2. Add subset computation for large datasets
3. Handle edge cases (single clusters, single-point clusters)
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Optimize performance for large datasets

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Implementation**:
   - `silhouetteScore`: Full computation with all pairwise distances
   - `silhouetteScoreSubset`: Compute score for a subset of samples (useful for large datasets)

2. **Formula Implementation**:
   ```
   s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))
   ```
   Where:
   - a(i) = mean distance from i to all other points in same cluster
   - b(i) = mean distance from i to all points in nearest cluster
   - Score ranges from -1 to +1

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Single-point clusters: Assigned silhouette score of 0
   - Single cluster: Throws error (requires at least 2 clusters)
   - Identical points: Handled gracefully with proper distance computation

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) for full computation due to pairwise distances
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for distance matrix
- **Subset Optimization**: O(n·m) where m is subset size

### Score Interpretation

1. **+1**: Sample is far from neighboring clusters (perfect clustering)
2. **0**: Sample is on or very close to decision boundary
3. **-1**: Sample might have been assigned to wrong cluster

### Test Suite Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic functionality with various cluster configurations
- Score interpretation (high for separated, low for overlapping)
- Tensor and array input compatibility
- Edge cases (single cluster, single-point clusters)
- Known values (perfect separation = 1.0, boundary = 0.0)
- Subset computation correctness
- Numerical stability tests
- Performance comparison between full and subset computation

All 14 tests pass successfully.

### Key Insights

1. **Computationally Expensive**: O(n²) complexity makes it impractical for very large datasets
2. **Subset Sampling**: The subset implementation provides a good approximation with significant speedup
3. **Sensitive Metric**: Effectively identifies misclassified points and cluster overlap
4. **Bounded Scale**: [-1, 1] range makes interpretation straightforward
5. **Best for Final Validation**: Due to computational cost, best used for final validation rather than optimization loops
