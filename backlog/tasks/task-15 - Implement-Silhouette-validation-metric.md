## Description

Implement the Silhouette score which measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, ranging from -1 to +1

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function signature matches design specification
- [ ] Full pairwise distance matrix computation
- [ ] Cohesion calculation (a(i)) for each sample
- [ ] Separation calculation (b(i)) for each sample
- [ ] Individual silhouette coefficient computation
- [ ] Mean silhouette score calculation
- [ ] Handling of edge cases (single cluster)
- [ ] Unit tests covering various scenarios
- [ ] Validation against scikit-learn implementation
