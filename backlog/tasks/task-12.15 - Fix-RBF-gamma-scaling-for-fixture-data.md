## Description

Task 12.5 discovered that RBF fixtures use gamma=1.0 but sklearn actually needs much smaller values (0.1-0.7) for the data scales. Either fix the fixtures or implement proper gamma auto-scaling.

**Insights from cluster analysis**:

- RBF affinity generally performs worse than k-NN on overlapping clusters
- All RBF fixtures with overlapping clusters (circles, moons) are failing
- The gamma parameter is critical for handling different cluster densities and overlaps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Analyze correct gamma values for each RBF fixture
- [x] Verify our RBF implementation matches sklearn
- [x] Confirm gamma=1.0 is correct for fixtures
- [ ] Achieve comparable results to k-NN tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze gamma values and data scales in RBF fixtures
2. Test our RBF affinity computation against sklearn
3. Debug why RBF tests fail despite correct implementation
4. Document findings

## Implementation Notes

### Key Findings

After extensive analysis:

1. **Gamma values are correct**: All RBF fixtures use gamma=1.0, and sklearn achieves perfect ARI=1.0 with this value
2. **Our RBF implementation is correct**: Produces identical affinity matrices to sklearn
3. **The real issue**: RBF with gamma=1.0 creates effectively disconnected graphs (3 components)
4. **Root cause**: Same as task 12.16 - our eigenvalue solver doesn't produce component indicator eigenvectors

### Analysis Results

For blobs_n2_rbf with gamma=1.0:

- Creates 3 connected components (one per spatial blob)
- sklearn achieves ARI=1.0 using shift-invert eigensolver
- Our implementation achieves ARI=0.088 due to eigenvalue solver differences

The RBF tests are failing for the same reason as disconnected k-NN graphs: we need shift-invert eigenvalue computation to produce proper component indicator eigenvectors.

### Conclusion

No changes needed to RBF implementation or gamma values. The fixture tests will pass once we implement shift-invert eigenvalue computation (future task).
