## Description

Implement a pragmatic solution for handling disconnected graphs in spectral clustering by creating explicit component indicators when disconnected components are detected. This avoids the complexity of full shift-invert implementation while solving the immediate problem of failing fixture tests.

When the affinity graph has multiple connected components, we'll create component indicator vectors directly using graph traversal, then use these as features for k-means clustering.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Detect disconnected graphs and switch to component indicator mode
- [x] Create component indicator vectors using graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
- [x] Integrate smoothly with existing spectral clustering pipeline
- [x] Pass all currently failing disconnected graph tests
- [x] Maintain performance for connected graphs (no regression)
- [ ] Add unit tests for component indicator creation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance Component Detection

Update `detectConnectedComponents` to return component labels:

```typescript
export function detectConnectedComponents(
  affinity: tf.Tensor2D,
  tolerance: number = 1e-10
): { 
  numComponents: number; 
  isFullyConnected: boolean;
  componentLabels: Int32Array;  // New: which component each node belongs to
}
```

### 2. Create Component Indicators

Implement a new function to create indicator vectors:

```typescript
export function createComponentIndicators(
  affinity: tf.Tensor2D,
  numComponents: number,
  componentLabels: Int32Array
): tf.Tensor2D {
  // Create indicator matrix where each column is constant per component
  // Similar to sklearn's shift-invert eigenvectors
  const n = affinity.shape[0];
  const indicators = new Float32Array(n * numComponents);
  
  // Count nodes per component for normalization
  const componentSizes = new Array(numComponents).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    componentSizes[componentLabels[i]]++;
  }
  
  // Fill indicators with normalized values
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const comp = componentLabels[i];
    // Use 1/sqrt(size) normalization like eigenvectors
    indicators[i * numComponents + comp] = 1.0 / Math.sqrt(componentSizes[comp]);
  }
  
  return tf.tensor2d(indicators, [n, numComponents]);
}
```

### 3. Integrate into SpectralClustering

Modify the spectral clustering pipeline:

```typescript
// In spectral.ts fit() method:

// Detect components
const { numComponents, isFullyConnected, componentLabels } = 
  detectConnectedComponents(this.affinityMatrix_);

let U: tf.Tensor2D;

if (!isFullyConnected && numComponents >= this.params.nClusters) {
  // Use component indicators for disconnected graphs
  console.warn("Using component indicators for disconnected graph");
  
  // Create indicators for first nClusters components
  const indicators = createComponentIndicators(
    this.affinityMatrix_,
    Math.min(numComponents, this.params.nClusters),
    componentLabels
  );
  
  // Apply diffusion map scaling for consistency
  U = indicators;
} else {
  // Use standard eigenvector approach for connected graphs
  // ... existing eigenvector code ...
}
```

### 4. Handle Edge Cases

1. **More clusters than components**: If `nClusters > numComponents`, combine component indicators with standard eigenvectors
2. **Very small components**: Filter out components with < 2 nodes
3. **Numerical stability**: Ensure proper normalization of indicators

### 5. Optimize Graph Traversal

For efficiency, implement component detection using optimized BFS:

```typescript
function findComponentsBFS(affinity: tf.Tensor2D, threshold: number = 1e-10): Int32Array {
  const n = affinity.shape[0];
  const labels = new Int32Array(n).fill(-1);
  const affinityData = affinity.arraySync();
  let currentLabel = 0;
  
  for (let start = 0; start < n; start++) {
    if (labels[start] !== -1) continue;
    
    // BFS from this node
    const queue = [start];
    labels[start] = currentLabel;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
      const node = queue.shift()!;
      
      for (let neighbor = 0; neighbor < n; neighbor++) {
        if (labels[neighbor] === -1 && affinityData[node][neighbor] > threshold) {
          labels[neighbor] = currentLabel;
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
    
    currentLabel++;
  }
  
  return labels;
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. Test component detection on known graphs:
   - Fully connected graph → 1 component
   - Block diagonal matrix → multiple components
   - Nearly disconnected graph → threshold sensitivity

2. Test indicator creation:
   - Correct normalization
   - Orthogonality of indicators
   - Matches expected pattern

### Integration Tests

1. Test with failing fixtures:
   - `blobs_n2_knn` (3 components, 2 clusters)
   - All RBF fixtures with disconnected graphs

2. Verify no regression on passing tests:
   - Connected k-NN graphs
   - Well-separated clusters

### Performance Tests

- Measure overhead of component detection
- Compare clustering time vs standard approach
- Memory usage for large graphs

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Immediate fix**: All 7 failing disconnected graph tests should pass
2. **Clean integration**: Seamless fallback to standard approach for connected graphs
3. **Future-proof**: Easy to replace with full shift-invert if needed later

## Implementation Notes

This approach is similar to what we already started in `src/utils/component_indicators.ts`. We'll refine and integrate it properly into the main pipeline.

### Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the component indicator approach:

1. **Updated `detectConnectedComponents`** to use BFS graph traversal and return component labels
2. **Enhanced `createComponentIndicators`** to accept component labels and create normalized indicator vectors
3. **Integrated into `SpectralClustering`** to automatically use component indicators for disconnected graphs
4. **Fixed critical bug**: Use all component indicators (not just nClusters) to avoid zero vectors

### Results

- **2 additional tests now passing**: blobs_n2_knn and blobs_n2_rbf (both had 3 disconnected components)
- **Total passing**: 7/12 tests (up from 5/12)
- **No regressions**: All previously passing tests still pass
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from component detection

### Remaining Failures

The 5 remaining failures (circles and moons RBF tests, circles_n3_knn) are for connected graphs where standard eigenvectors are used. These still require shift-invert implementation for full sklearn parity.

The core issue is that our eigenvectors have many unique values while sklearn's have constant values per component.

### Further Investigation of Remaining Failures

After implementing component indicators, I investigated whether shift-invert is necessary for the remaining 5 failing tests:

**Key Findings:**

1. **All remaining failures are connected graphs** (single component):
   - circles_n2_rbf, circles_n3_knn, circles_n3_rbf
   - moons_n2_rbf, moons_n3_rbf

2. **Component indicators don't apply** to connected graphs - they only help with disconnected components

3. **sklearn achieves perfect ARI=1.0** on all these tests WITHOUT using shift-invert mode

4. **The issue is NOT algorithmic** - sklearn uses standard eigendecomposition for these connected graphs:
   - First eigenvector: constant (1 unique value) - this is expected
   - Other eigenvectors: smooth variation (60 unique values) capturing cluster structure

5. **Root cause analysis** - The failures are likely due to:
   - Numerical accuracy differences in our eigendecomposition vs sklearn's ARPACK
   - Possible eigenvector ordering differences
   - Small differences in diffusion map scaling
   - K-means initialization sensitivity to small numerical differences

**Conclusion:** Shift-invert is NOT needed for the remaining tests. We need to improve the numerical accuracy of our standard eigendecomposition implementation or fix subtle bugs in eigenvector selection/scaling.
