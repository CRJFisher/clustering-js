## Description

Integrate all components of SpectralClustering to create the complete algorithm from affinity matrix through spectral embedding to final clustering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full pipeline integration from input to cluster labels
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout the pipeline
- [ ] Memory management for large intermediate tensors
- [ ] Edge case handling (degenerate affinity matrices)
- [ ] Validation against scikit-learn SpectralClustering
- [ ] Performance benchmarks on various datasets
- [ ] Documentation of numerical considerations
