## Description

Implement the core linkage criteria algorithms (ward, complete, average, single) that determine how clusters are merged in the hierarchical clustering process

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [ ] Complete linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [ ] Average linkage criterion implemented and tested
- [ ] Ward linkage criterion implemented with variance calculations
- [ ] Distance matrix update logic for each linkage type
- [ ] Unit tests validating linkage calculations
- [ ] Integration tests with small example datasets
