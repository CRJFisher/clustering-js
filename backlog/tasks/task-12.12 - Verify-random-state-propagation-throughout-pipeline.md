## Description

Ensure that the random state is properly propagated and used consistently throughout the entire spectral clustering pipeline. Check that k-means initialization, tie-breaking in k-NN, and any other stochastic components are using the random state correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Random state is used in k-means++ initialization
- [ ] Random state is used in k-NN tie-breaking if applicable
- [ ] Random state usage matches sklearn's pattern
- [ ] Results are deterministic for same random seed
