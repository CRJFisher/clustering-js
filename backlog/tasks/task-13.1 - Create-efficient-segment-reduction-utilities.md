## Description

Implement TensorFlow.js segment reduction operations for efficiently computing cluster statistics needed by validation metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Segment sum operation for cluster aggregation
- [ ] Segment mean calculation for centroids
- [ ] Segment count for cluster sizes
- [ ] Masked tensor operations for cluster selection
- [ ] Performance optimization using tf.gather
- [ ] Unit tests validating correctness
