## Description

Refactor the library to support dynamic backend selection, enabling automatic detection and use of the best available backend (CPU, WASM, WebGL, tfjs-node, tfjs-node-gpu) based on the environment and installed dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dynamic backend detection and initialization system implemented
- [ ] Browser support enabled with WebGL and WASM backends
- [ ] Node.js backend auto-selection between tfjs-node and tfjs-node-gpu
- [ ] Fallback mechanism when preferred backend unavailable
- [ ] Backend can be manually specified via configuration
- [ ] All algorithms work seamlessly across all backends
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved across backends
- [ ] Browser bundle created without Node.js dependencies
- [ ] Tests pass in both Node.js and browser environments
- [ ] Documentation updated with backend configuration guide
- [ ] README updated to reflect new installation options
- [ ] API docs updated with backend configuration examples
- [ ] Browser usage examples added to documentation
- [ ] Migration guide for existing users updated
