## Description

Compute the normalized graph Laplacian and perform eigendecomposition to create the spectral embedding, which is the core of spectral clustering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Degree matrix calculation from affinity matrix
- [ ] Normalized Laplacian computation (L_sym = I - D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2))
- [ ] Eigendecomposition using tf.linalg.eig()
- [ ] Eigenvalue/eigenvector sorting implementation
- [ ] Selection of k smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors
- [ ] Numerical stability checks and handling
- [ ] Unit tests validating mathematical correctness
