## Description

Implement the Calinski-Harabasz score which measures the ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster dispersion for evaluating clustering quality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function signature matches design specification
- [ ] Global centroid calculation implemented
- [ ] Cluster centroids and sizes computed efficiently
- [ ] Within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) calculation
- [ ] Between-cluster sum of squares (BSS) calculation
- [ ] Final score computation with proper formula
- [ ] Unit tests with known expected values
- [ ] Validation against scikit-learn implementation
