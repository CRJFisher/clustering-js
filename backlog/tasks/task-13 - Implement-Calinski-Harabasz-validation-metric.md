## Description

Implement the Calinski-Harabasz score which measures the ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster dispersion for evaluating clustering quality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Function signature matches design specification
- [x] Global centroid calculation implemented
- [x] Cluster centroids and sizes computed efficiently
- [x] Within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) calculation
- [x] Between-cluster sum of squares (BSS) calculation
- [x] Final score computation with proper formula
- [x] Unit tests with known expected values
- [x] Validation against scikit-learn implementation

## Implementation Plan

1. Create validation directory structure
2. Implement the CH score calculation following sklearn's approach
3. Add memory-efficient version for large datasets
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Validate against sklearn reference values

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Implementation**: Created both standard and memory-efficient versions
   - `calinskiHarabasz`: Uses tf.tidy for automatic memory management
   - `calinskiHarabaszEfficient`: Processes clusters sequentially to minimize memory usage

2. **Input Flexibility**: Accepts both tensor and array inputs for easy integration

3. **Formula Implementation**:
   ```
   CH = (BSS / (k - 1)) / (WSS / (n - k))
   ```
   Where:
   - BSS = Between-cluster sum of squares (weighted by cluster size)
   - WSS = Within-cluster sum of squares
   - k = number of clusters
   - n = number of samples

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ·k) where n is samples and k is clusters
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the efficient version
- **Benchmark**: Processes 1000 samples in < 10ms

### Validation Results

1. **sklearn Comparison**: Exact match (3.375) for reference dataset
2. **Edge Cases**: Properly handles single cluster error and k >= n error
3. **Numerical Stability**: Works with very small distances and large feature values
4. **Performance**: Efficient version handles 1000+ samples quickly

### Test Suite Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic functionality with well-separated clusters
- Tensor and array input compatibility
- Edge cases (single cluster, k >= n)
- Different cluster sizes
- Known values from sklearn
- Numerical stability tests
- Performance benchmarks

All 11 tests pass successfully.
