## Description

The build process is only creating dist/index.js but not dist/clustering.browser.js and dist/clustering.node.js, causing size-check and other tests to fail

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] dist/clustering.browser.js is created by build process
- [ ] dist/clustering.node.js is created by build process
- [ ] size-check job passes
- [ ] All bundle files have appropriate sizes

## Implementation Notes

Changed the size-check job in multi-platform.yml to use 'npm run build:multi' instead of 'npm run build'. This ensures all bundles (browser, node, and standard) are built before checking sizes.
