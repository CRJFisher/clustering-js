## Description

Create a lightweight K-Means implementation to cluster the spectral embedding as the final step of SpectralClustering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Basic K-Means class with fit method
- [ ] K-means++ initialization implemented
- [ ] Lloyd's algorithm for iterative optimization
- [ ] Convergence criteria and maximum iterations
- [ ] Integration with SpectralClustering embedding
- [ ] Unit tests for K-Means functionality
- [ ] Validation against reference implementations
