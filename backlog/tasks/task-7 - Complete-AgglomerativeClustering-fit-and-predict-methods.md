## Description

Implement the complete clustering algorithm by integrating distance computation, linkage criteria, and iterative merging to produce final cluster labels

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Iterative merging loop implemented
- [ ] Cluster merge tracking in children_ tensor
- [ ] Final label assignment from dendrogram traversal
- [ ] Memory-efficient tensor operations throughout
- [ ] Edge cases handled (single sample
- [ ] all in one cluster)
- [ ] Validation against scikit-learn outputs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks on various dataset sizes
