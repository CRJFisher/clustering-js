## Description

The current Jacobi eigensolver has accuracy limitations that prevent achieving sklearn parity. Need to investigate more accurate eigensolvers or improve the existing implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Eigensolver produces eigenvalues/vectors matching scipy.linalg.eigh within tolerance
- [ ] At least 10/12 fixture tests pass with ARI >= 0.95
- [x] Performance remains acceptable (< 5s for typical datasets)

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current Jacobi eigensolver to identify accuracy bottlenecks
2. Research alternative approaches (Lanczos, QR iteration, etc.)
3. Consider using WebAssembly or other numerical libraries
4. Implement improvements or alternative solver
5. Benchmark accuracy vs scipy and performance
6. Integrate with spectral clustering pipeline
7. Verify fixture test improvements

## Implementation Notes

### Approach

Implemented an improved Jacobi eigensolver with the following enhancements:

1. **Cyclic Jacobi method** - Systematically sweep through all off-diagonal pairs instead of always choosing the largest
2. **Adaptive threshold scaling** - Reduce threshold as convergence improves
3. **PSD-specific handling** - Clamp small negative eigenvalues to zero for positive semi-definite matrices
4. **Better numerical stability** - Improved handling of very small pivots to avoid division by near-zero

### Key Code Changes

- Created `src/utils/eigen_improved.ts` with `improved_jacobi_eigen()` function
- Modified `smallest_eigenvectors()` in `laplacian.ts` to use the improved solver
- Added `isPSD` flag to handle normalized Laplacians correctly
- Increased max iterations from 2000 to 3000
- Set eigenvalue clamping threshold to 1e-8 for PSD matrices

### Results

- **Eigenvalue accuracy**: Now produces non-negative eigenvalues for Laplacian matrices (previously had values like -9.884e-9)
- **Performance**: Typical matrices (60x60) solve in ~50ms, well within the 5s requirement
- **Fixture tests**: Results remain at 5/12 passing (41.7%) - same as before the improvements

### Analysis

The eigensolver improvements successfully addressed numerical issues (negative eigenvalues) but did not improve fixture test results. Investigation revealed:

1. Most failures have high ARI scores (0.75-0.90) with only 2-4 misclassified samples out of 60
2. Increasing k-means iterations (nInit = 10, 20, 50) showed no improvement
3. The eigenvalue spectrum looks reasonable with clear gaps

This suggests the remaining discrepancies are due to other algorithmic differences with sklearn rather than eigensolver precision. Possible areas for future investigation:

- RBF gamma parameter handling
- k-means++ seeding details
- Affinity matrix construction edge cases
