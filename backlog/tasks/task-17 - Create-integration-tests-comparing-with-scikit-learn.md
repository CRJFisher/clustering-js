## Description

Develop comprehensive integration tests that validate the TypeScript implementations against scikit-learn outputs using various synthetic and real-world datasets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test datasets prepared (blobs
- [ ] moons
- [ ] circles)
- [ ] Python scripts generate expected outputs for all algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests for AgglomerativeClustering with all linkage types
- [ ] Integration tests for SpectralClustering with both affinity types
- [ ] Integration tests for all validation metrics
- [ ] Tolerance thresholds defined for numerical differences
- [ ] Edge case tests (empty data
- [ ] single cluster
- [ ] outliers)
- [ ] Performance comparison reports generated
