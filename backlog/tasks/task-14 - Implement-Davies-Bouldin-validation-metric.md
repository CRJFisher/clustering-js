## Description

Implement the Davies-Bouldin score which measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster for clustering evaluation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function signature matches design specification
- [ ] Cluster centroid calculation for all clusters
- [ ] Intra-cluster dispersion calculation (s_i)
- [ ] Inter-cluster distance matrix computation
- [ ] Similarity ratio calculation for cluster pairs
- [ ] Maximum similarity selection per cluster
- [ ] Final score as average of maximum similarities
- [ ] Unit tests with expected values
- [ ] Validation against scikit-learn implementation
