## Description

Despite implementing deterministic k-means++ initialization, there may still be subtle differences in how we select initial centers compared to sklearn. Investigate and align the exact k-means++ implementation, including how distances are computed and how random choices are made.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] K-means++ initialization matches sklearn's exact algorithm
- [ ] Random state usage follows sklearn's pattern
- [ ] Initial centers are identical for same random seed
- [ ] Blobs dataset tests show improved clustering
