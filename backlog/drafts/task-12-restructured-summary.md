# Task 12 Restructured Summary

## Current Status: 6/12 tests passing (50%)

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ 12.1 - Fix k-NN default nNeighbors (found ARI bug instead)
- ✅ 12.2 - Add k-NN self-loops (improved to 3/12)
- ✅ 12.3 - Drop trivial eigenvectors (already correct)
- ✅ 12.4 - Fix row normalization (discovered sklearn doesn't use it)
- ✅ 12.4.1 - Improve eigensolver accuracy (fixed numerical issues)
- ✅ 12.5 - Investigate RBF affinity (found gamma=1.0 issue)
- ✅ 12.6 - Compare spectral embeddings (removed diffusion scaling)
- ✅ 12.7 - Align k-means empty cluster handling
- ✅ 12.8 - Float64 precision (Won't Do - TensorFlow.js limitation)
- ✅ Old 12.11 - Debug blobs failures (found k-NN symmetrization bug, improved to 6/12!)

## High Priority Tasks (Implementation Order)
1. **12.10** - Debug two-cluster special case (blobs_n2 with ARI=0.088)
2. **12.11** - Fix RBF gamma scaling (based on 12.5 findings)
3. **12.12** - Complete random state propagation
4. **12.13** - Handle disconnected graph components
5. **12.14** - Final comprehensive sklearn comparison

## Additional Tasks (Based on Cluster Analysis)
- **12.17** - Improve spectral clustering for overlapping clusters
- **12.18** - Investigate 2-cluster vs 3-cluster performance difference

## Deprioritized Tasks
- **12.15** - Debug k-means initialization (already correct)
- **12.16** - Investigate affinity matrix sparsity (optimization for later)

## Key Discoveries
1. **k-NN symmetrization bug**: Changed from max(A, A^T) to 0.5 * (A + A^T) - major fix!
2. **RBF gamma issue**: Fixtures use gamma=1.0 but need ~0.1-0.7
3. **Row normalization**: sklearn doesn't use it for k-means method
4. **Float64**: Not available in TensorFlow.js, but not the bottleneck
5. **Cluster overlap analysis**: 8/12 fixtures have overlapping clusters, but overlap doesn't determine failure
6. **blobs_n2 paradox**: Excellent separation (silhouette 0.741) but catastrophic failure (ARI 0.088) - proves it's an algorithmic issue
7. **Affinity patterns**: k-NN consistently outperforms RBF on overlapping clusters

## Recommended Next Action
Start with task 12.10 to debug why two-cluster cases fail catastrophically. This is likely a simple fix that could unlock multiple test improvements.
